This report describes a novel approach for performing data mining on website meta data and statistics. Being able to find patterns and statistics in the diverse landscape of the web, is of interest to online businesses and for web statistics in general. Based on a business concept developed by Statistico, a new-found subsidary of a company residing in Aarhus in Denmark, we present the results of data mining projects using enriched website meta-data, which is the kind of data that Statistico wants to build its business on. We show that the data set can be used to find a correlation between website's page-rank and meta-data. The correlation found is interesting because it can be derived from a data set that is publicly accessible, and is based on relatively few features. With future work, the implications of performing the presented data mining process, could be new tools for Business Intelligence.
