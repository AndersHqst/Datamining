This report describes a novel idea of performing data mining on website meta data. We describe a small system that collects meta data from 2425 websites and extracts a total of 44 features from each site. We show how a substantial amount of general statistics can be derived, and that we are able to find meaningful clusters in the data. Furthermore we provide prediction results that show that it seems unlikely that we can predict the PageRank of a website, given the limited meta data. Being able to find patterns and statistics in the diverse landscape of the web, is of interest to on-line businesses, and for web statistics in general. With future work, the implications of performing the presented data mining process, could be display of unique web statistics or new tools for Business Intelligence.
