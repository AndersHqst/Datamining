\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have show that a a lot of figures and trends can be derived from scraping websites and making use of a few services. We find this kind of statistics could be of particular interest, as it displays quite unique figures on what attributes are common on the web. We also conclude, that while the HTML data is noisy and diverse, we can recognize certain clusters in the data. By extending on our setup, we assert that it would possible to establish an interesting overview of trends and correlations in web site meta data.
