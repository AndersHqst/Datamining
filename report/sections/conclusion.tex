\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have shown that a a lot of figures and trends can be derived from scraping websites and making use of a few auxiliary services, such as those provided by Alexa. 

We find this kind of statistics to be of particular interest, as it displays quite unique figures on the trends of current websites. We also conclude, that whereas the scraped data is noisy and diverse, it is possible recognize certain clusters in the data, each representing different trends among the websites. Finally, we have found it difficult to predict the PageRank of a given website, based on its intrinsic data alone.

By extending the applied techniques, we assert that it would be possible to establish an interesting and thorough overview of trends and correlations among websites in general.
