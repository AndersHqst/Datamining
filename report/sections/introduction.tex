Statistico general interest in these figures, and have a novel idea of scraping all web data, and make meta data searchable. What does their data mean? Patterns in server, CMS, HTML version. Stats are of general interest, and there are actually not much clean data and overview of the landscape of websites and their meta data.

\subsection{Data set}
\label{subsec:data_set}
Introduce the size of Statistico and the problem of delivering the data. Present right away that we do not have time to run in on their data set, but that we have collected a subset, and that our setup would work on the big set, but would take 17 days to run.

\paragraph{Motivation}
Why we think this is interesting. We know that the data set will be difficult to derive anything from, but we find that there is actually a real world scenario where our results could be useful, if the project is worked on in the future.

\paragraph{Overview}
Present sections and their content.
