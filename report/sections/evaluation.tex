\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
\todo{I imagine this is our prime section.}
Diagrams and numbers. Evaluate and reflect upon all results. Can we say anything?

\subsection{Clustering}
\label{subsec:clustering}

Clustering is the only thing that seems to make the slightest sense :(

Explain the results

\subsection{Prediction and classification}
\label{subsec:predictclassify}

This does not seem to work. Why? Loosely correlated features? Why does K-Means clustering make sense when K-NN does not???
